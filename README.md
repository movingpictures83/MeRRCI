# MERRCI
Pipeline that combines Metagenome, Resistome, Replicome for Causal Inferencing (MERRCI)

MERRCI is a novel scalable pipeline with a two-step process of establishing a causal connection between microbiome variables.
The first step involves computing microbial metagenomics composition (MMC), antibiotic resistance (ABR) profiles,
and replication rates (PTR). In the second step, a causal structure learning algorithm was applied to discern relationships
between the computed MMC, PTR, ABR, and the clinical variables.
